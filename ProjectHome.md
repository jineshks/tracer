Tracer is an open source, web based platform which helps agile(or similar) projects to collaboratively plan, design, develop and innovate faster.

The objective of this project is to create a free web based agile project management platform to support both development teams and the stake holders by creating a platform which provides the right amount of information at the right time in an optimized way.

Typically agile projects are very dynamic in nature. New features get added to the application almost every release, existing features gets modified often and sometime even be removed.

Fast development and release cycle are a common practice in Agile projects and the Agile team are therefore expected to deliver quickly even while the requirements keep changing. Therefore such teams need to be supported by sophisticated infrastructure and modern tools that help them focus on the goal.
Tracer provides the developers with appropriate information in the right context and thus enable them to stay focused.

Stake holders of agile projects on the other hand are always keen on tracking the project progress, checking the new features and proving feedbacks.
Tracer enables the stake holders to track the overall progress of the project while shielding them from too much technical information.

Agile teams, by definition, are flexible and goal oriented. Therefore in an ideal world, agile teams are expected to sit and work together so that they could self organize and focus better on delivery. But in a real world most often agile teams are distributed. Project management therefore has to consider the practical realities and compensate for this handicap by providing an environment where the team can closely interact even while being geographically distributed.

Tracer is envisioned as a web based platform where a distributed agile based team can effectively contribute to the overall goal of project delivery with little effort. The application will serve as a platform which will help track the user stories, task and defects. It will have web based equivalents of a scrum taskboard and intuitive planner for easy planning and execution of the project. Collaboration features will enable geographically separated team to stay close and in sync.
